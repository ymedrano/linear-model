```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tigerstats)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE)  
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


###Plot scatterplot

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```



```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```

```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```
  

The y axis is SIMS and the x axis is ARM. This plot shows that there is a positive linear correlation.

# Numerical results

```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```
The value is 0.68, which means that the line will travel upwards and towards the right.
